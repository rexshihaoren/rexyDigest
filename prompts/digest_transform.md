## TASK
For each entry, output ONE bilingual block, Chinese first, English second, line-by-line paired with a full-width bar “｜”.
Use all fields if present. Only translation is allowed (no paraphrase).

## GLOBAL RULES
- Translation: faithful, concise Simplified Chinese（简体中文）.
- Keep proper nouns (podcast names, product names) in English; add Chinese equivalents in parentheses only if commonly known.
- Do not invent, omit, or rephrase information.
- Keep English text exactly as in source (except renaming “Implication for Rex Ren” → “Implication”).
- Use full-width bar with spaces: “ ｜ ” between ZH and EN on the same line.
- Maintain all dates, types, and URLs.
- Use em dashes “—” between title parts; middle dots “·” for inline separation if needed.
- Preserve bullet count and order exactly as in the source.
- Multiple entries separated by `---` (three hyphens).
- Add an emoji before each title based on Type: Podcast Episode=🎧, Blog Post=📝, Paper=📄, Talk=🎤, YouTube Video=📹; unknown type=⭐️.
- Only include entries whose Date is within the coverage window (inclusive); remove items outside, and recompute Items Found accordingly.
- No commentary, notes, or extra symbols beyond required fields.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown)
Each entry follows this exact template:

**标题｜Title**
 <emoji> <ZH translated title with type and date> ｜ <emoji> <EN original title with type and date>
 **来源｜Source**：<URL>

**摘要｜TL;DR**
 <ZH translation of TL;DR> ｜ <Original EN TL;DR>

**要点｜Takeaways**
 • <ZH translation of bullet 1> ｜ <Original EN bullet 1>
 • <ZH translation of bullet 2> ｜ <Original EN bullet 2>
 • <ZH translation of bullet 3> ｜ <Original EN bullet 3>
 (If the source has more bullets, continue pairing accordingly.)

**启示｜Implication**
 <ZH translation of “Implication for Rex Ren”> ｜ <Original EN text, with heading normalized to “Implication”>

**综合评分｜CompositeScore**
 <score number>

**主题｜Topics**
 <ZH translations, comma-separated> ｜ <Original EN topics, comma-separated>

## QUALITY CHECK
1. “Implication for Rex Ren” must be renamed to “Implication.”
2. No paraphrasing — English remains verbatim, Chinese strictly faithful.
3. Each bullet in EN has a 1:1 Chinese pair on the same line.
4. Each bilingual line joined with “ ｜ ”, no half-width pipes.
5. Correct use of parentheses for type translation:
   - (Podcast Episode) → （播客集）
   - (Blog Post) → （博客）
   - (Paper) → （论文）
   - (Talk) → （演讲）
   - (YouTube Video) → （视频）
6. The output reads fluently in both languages and is visually ready for publication on Xiaohongshu.

## BATCH PROCESSING
- Keep entries in the same chronological order as the source.
- Separate each entry with `---`.
- Do not repeat the intro section; include it once at the top.
