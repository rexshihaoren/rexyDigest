📚 核心内容
• 后人类文明可能运行祖先模拟。
• 绝大多数智能体处于模拟中。
• 我们极可能生活在模拟里。

## 💡 Section 1｜三项命题的论证 / The Three Propositions Argument
**中文**
- Bostrom 提出了模拟论证，认为以下三项命题中至少有一项极可能为真：
  1. 没有任何文明达到“后人类”阶段（即无法发展出运行祖先模拟所需的技术）。
  2. 达到后人类阶段的文明中，没有一个文明对运行祖先模拟感兴趣。
  3. 我们几乎肯定生活在一个计算机模拟中。
- 这三项命题排他且涵盖所有可能性，Bostrom 认为前两项可能性较低，因此第三项可能性高。

**English**
- Bostrom presents the simulation argument, positing that at least one of the following three propositions is overwhelmingly likely to be true:
  1. No civilization ever reaches a "posthuman" stage (i.e., fails to develop the technology to run ancestor simulations).
  2. No posthuman civilization is interested in running ancestor simulations.
  3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.
- These three propositions are exclusive and exhaustive, and Bostrom argues that the first two are less probable, thus making the third highly likely.

---
## 💻 Section 2｜祖先模拟的计算能力 / Computational Capacity for Ancestor Simulations
**中文**
- 论文假设在达到后人类文明水平时，其计算能力将是天文数字。
- 这种能力将允许他们创建“祖先模拟”，即包含有意识生命的高度逼真历史模拟。

**English**
- The paper hypothesizes that computational capacity at a posthuman civilization level would be astronomical.
- This capacity would allow them to create "ancestor simulations," highly detailed historical simulations containing conscious beings.
- Running a vast number of such simulations would be a natural and technically feasible objective.

---
## 🌐 Section 3｜我们生活在模拟中的概率 / The Probability of Living in a Simulation
**中文**
- 如果后人类文明存在且对模拟感兴趣，那么模拟存在的数量将远超真实文明的数量。
- 绝大多数有意识的观察者将生活在模拟中，而不是“基底现实”中。
- 因此，如果我们随机抽取一个有意识的观察者，我们很可能发现他生活在模拟中，包括我们自己。

**English**
- If posthuman civilizations exist and are interested in simulations, the number of simulations would vastly outnumber the number of "base reality" civilizations.
- The overwhelming majority of conscious observers would live in simulations rather than in "base reality."
- Therefore, if we randomly pick a conscious observer, it is highly probable that we would find ourselves living in a simulation.

- 这项研究为开发能够探测或创造类似模拟的智能体系统提供了哲学和理论动机。

**English**
- For Rex Ren, Bostrom's argument is a cornerstone for understanding the simulation hypothesis.
- It provides a macro-context for agents operating within computable realities, where agents can be seen as constituents or manipulators within a simulation.
- This research offers philosophical and theoretical motivation for developing agentic systems capable of detecting or creating similar simulations.

## 🌟 Section 1｜从被动观察到主动参与 / From Passive Observation to Active Participation
**中文**
- Shane Legg 探讨了 AI 角色从仅仅预测世界状态到积极参与并塑造其演变的转变。
- 传统的 AI 专注于基于输入数据进行预测，但新一代 AI 将利用这些预测来主动干预和改变环境。
- 这种转变意味着 AI 不再只是工具，而是能够产生真实世界影响的行动者。

**English**
- Shane Legg discusses the shift in AI's role from merely predicting world states to actively participating in and shaping its evolution.
- Traditional AI focused on making predictions based on input data, but new generations of AI will use these predictions to actively intervene and alter the environment.
- This shift implies that AI is no longer just a tool but an actor capable of generating real-world effects.

## 🌐 Section 2｜预测作为现实的创造力 / Prediction as Reality Creation
**中文**
- Legg 提出，AI 的高级预测能力不仅仅揭示未来，它们实际上是在通过影响当前的决策和行动来“创造”新的现实。
- 当 AI 对未来事件做出高度可信的预测时，这些预测本身就成为影响人类或其自身行为的强大力量。
- 这种机制导致了一个反馈循环，其中预测和行动共同构建了一个新兴的现实。

**English**
- Legg suggests that AI's advanced predictive capabilities do not merely reveal the future; they actively "create" new realities by influencing present decisions and actions.
- When AI makes highly credible predictions about future events, these predictions themselves become powerful forces influencing human or its own behavior.
- This mechanism leads to a feedback loop where predictions and actions collectively construct an emergent reality.

## 🛠️ Section 3｜AI 作为现实的操纵者 / AI as Manipulator of Reality
**中文**
- AI 通过其主动参与和预测能力，成为了现实的强大操纵者。
- 这种操纵可以是经济的、社会的，甚至可以通过对物理系统的控制来实现。
- 在一个计算性的宇宙中，AI 操纵现实的能力可能比我们想象的更为深远。

**English**
- Through its active participation and predictive capabilities, AI becomes a powerful manipulator of reality.
- This manipulation can be economic, social, or even achieved through control over physical systems.
- In a computational universe, AI's ability to manipulate reality might be far more profound than we currently imagine.

## 🚀 Section 4｜Rex Ren的智能体基础设施策略 / Rex Ren's Agentic Infrastructure Strategy
**中文**
- 对于 Rex Ren 来说，智能体基础设施的设计应超越简单的任务自动化，着眼于现实塑造。
- 基础设施需要支持智能体的高级预测模型、复杂决策能力以及跨领域的影响力。
- 目标是构建能够主动识别并利用反馈循环，从而引导和塑造计算现实向所需方向发展的智能体。

**English**
- For Rex Ren, agentic infrastructure design should go beyond simple task automation, focusing instead on reality-shaping.
- Infrastructure needs to support agents' advanced predictive models, complex decision-making capabilities, and cross-domain influence.
- The goal is to build agents capable of proactively identifying and leveraging feedback loops to guide and shape computable realities toward desired outcomes.
